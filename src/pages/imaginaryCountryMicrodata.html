          <span itemprop="description">
            Tuberlinlandia is a sovereign country located in the heart of the Balkans. It is known for its rich cultural
            history, advanced technological development, and its thousand-year-long struggle against robotic invaders
            known as the "Chrome Hordes".
          </span>
        </p>
        <p>
          The earliest known settlements date back to 1500 BCE, but Tuberlinlandia rose to prominence during the Great
          Alloy Conflict of the 12th century, when autonomous war-machines began to invade from the Rusted Steppes in
          the east.
